    <h1>S.S.MOTA.SINGH.SR.SEC.MODEL.SCHOOL</h1>
    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>S. S.Mota Singh Model School was established in 1976 in Narang Colony, by our founder Chairman, Sardar Prithipal Singh Bhasin, who was a great visionary endowed with the intrinsic qualities of compassion, generosity, humanity and benevolence. The school was started in a temporary construction there but with the sincerity, earnestness and concerted efforts of the Chairman, the school soon became popular in the locality and achieved fame and success. It was soon shifted to permanent, well built, magnificent building with a huge playground and other facilities in A-4C Block, Janakpuri, New Delhi in July 1981 where at present  till date it stands as a great temple of learning.<br>

        This school carries the legacy of a renowned school, S.S.Mota Singh Khalsa Higher Secondary School in Nila in Pakistan by Sardar Mota Singh Ji. It was in 1916 that the foundation of the school in Nila was laid, because It was of Sardar Mota Singh ji’s spirit of service, firm determination and unlimited love for education, this school became famous far and wide. The deserving students from economically weaker sections  were provided free books, stationary and other requisites. The service rendered by this school between 1916 to 1947 cannot be described in words. In order to implement the noble task of reestablishing the school left in Pakistan, S.S.Mota Singh (Nila) Charitable Trust was formed and it was registered in December 1975 in Delhi<br>
        
        The traditional moral structure of this great institution of learning lays especial emphasis on the development of such traits as initiative, integrity, self confidence, emotional control, truthfulness, honesty and sincerity.<br>
        
        A keen desire for improvement and an eye for perfection have assisted the school to give excellent results in academics as well as co curricular activities year after year. The alumini of this school consist of many successful entrepreneurs and outstanding executives and many professionals in varied fields.
        
        Since its inception, the school has tried to synchronize co curricular activities with academics. The prestigious S.S.Mota Singh Memorial Hockey Tournament was started in the year 1982. It is an annual activity and is looked forward to by many eminent schools in and around Delhi for zealous participation.
        
        Children grow like weeds, unless they are spiritually and morally guided at school and at home. Keeping this in mind, the school prepares the young children to be capable of enriching the nation through their emotional, technical and professional skills, and with this aim, another branch of S.S.Mota Singh Sr. Sec. Model School was started in Guru Harkishan Nagar, Delhi in April 1984. At present the school has its two pre primary branches at Narang Colony and Guru Harkrishan Nagar. S. S. Mota Singh Sr. Sec. Model School, Janak Puri offers Science, Commerce and Humanities streams, and is well equipped with the latest modern facilities and a dedicated, well qualified staff.<br>
        
        It is rightly said “coming together is the beginning, being together is progress and working together is success.” Today, all the branches of this great institution are marching ahead with poise and confidence, spreading the light of knowledge, dispelling the darkness of ignorance under the competent leadership of the able daughter of an able father Ms. Kiran Bhasin Bhatia our  Chairperson at present.<br></p>
